/**
 * This is like a synchronizer, but it downloads records bit by bit, eventually
 * notifying that the local storage is up to date with the server contents.
 *
 * Because batches might be separated over time, it's possible for the server
 * state to change between calls. These state changes might include:
 *
 * 1. New changes arriving. This is fairly routine, but it's worth noting that
 *    changes might affect existing records that have been batched!
 * 2. Wipes. The collection (or the server as a whole) might be deleted. This
 *    should be accompanied by a change in syncID in meta/global; it's the caller's
 *    responsibility to detect this.
 * 3. A storage format change. This should be unfathomably rare, but if it happens
 *    we must also be prepared to discard our existing batched data.
 * 4. TTL expiry. We need to do better about TTL handling in general, but here
 *    we might find that a downloaded record is no longer live by the time we
 *    come to apply it! This doesn't apply to bookmark records, so we will ignore
 *    it for the moment.
 *
 * Batch downloading without continuation tokens is achieved as follows:
 *
 * * A minimum timestamp is established. This starts as zero.
 * * A fetch is issued against the server for records changed since that timestamp,
 *   ordered by modified time ascending, and limited to the batch size.
 * * If the batch is complete, we flush it to storage and advance the minimum
 *   timestamp to just before the newest record in the batch. This ensures that
 *   a divided set of records with the same modified times will be downloaded
 *   entirely so long as the set is never larger than the batch size.
 * * Iterate until we determine that there are no new records to fetch.
 *
 * Batch downloading with continuation tokens is much easier:
 *
 * * A minimum timestamp is established.
 * * Make a request with limit=N.
 * * Look for an X-Weave-Next-Offset header. Supply that in the next request.
 *   Also supply X-If-Unmodified-Since to avoid missed modifications.
 *
 * We do the latter, because we only support Sync 1.5. The use of the offset
 * allows us to efficiently process batches, particularly those that contain
 * large sets of records with the same timestamp. We still maintain the last
 * modified timestamp to allow for resuming a batch in the case of a conflicting
 * write, detected via X-I-U-S.
