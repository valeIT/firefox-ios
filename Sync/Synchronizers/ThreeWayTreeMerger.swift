/**
 * This class takes as input three 'trees'.
 *
 * The mirror is always complete, never contains deletions, never has
 * orphans, and has a single root.
 *
 * Each of local and buffer can contain a number of subtrees (each of which must
 * be a folder or root), a number of deleted GUIDs, and a number of orphans (records
 * with no known parent).
 *
 * It's very likely that there's almost no overlap, and thus no real conflicts to
 * resolve -- a three-way merge isn't always a bad thing -- but we won't know until
 * we compare records.
 *
 * Even though this is called 'three way merge', it also handles the case
 * of a two-way merge (one without a shared parent; for the roots, this will only
 * be on a first sync): content-based and structural merging is needed at all
 * layers of the hierarchy, so we simply generalize that to also apply to roots.
 *
 * In a sense, a two-way merge is solved by constructing a shared parent consisting of
 * roots, which are implicitly shared.
 * (Special care must be taken to not deduce that one side has deleted a root, of course,
 * as would be the case of a Sync server that doesn't contain
 * a Mobile Bookmarks folder -- the set of roots can only grow, not shrink.)
 *
 * To begin with we structurally reconcile. If necessary we will lazily fetch the
 * attributes of records in order to do a content-based reconciliation. Once we've
 * matched up any records that match (including remapping local GUIDs), we're able to
 * process _content_ changes, which is much simpler.
 *
 * We have to handle an arbitrary combination of the following structural operations:
 *
 * * Creating a folder.
 *   Created folders might now hold existing items, new items, or nothing at all.
 * * Creating a bookmark.
 *   It might be in a new folder or an existing folder.
 * * Moving one or more leaf records to an existing or new folder.
 * * Reordering the children of a folder.
 * * Deleting an entire subtree.
 * * Deleting an entire subtree apart from some moved nodes.
 * * Deleting a leaf node.
 * * Transplanting a subtree: moving a folder but not changing its children.
 *
 * And, of course, the non-structural operations such as renaming or changing URLs.
 *
 * We ignore all changes to roots themselves; the only acceptable operation on a root
 * is to change its children. The Places root is entirely immutable.
 *
 * Steps:
 * * Construct a collection of subtrees for local and buffer, and a complete tree for the mirror.
 *   The more thorough this step, the more confidence we have in consistency.
 * * Fetch all local and remote deletions. These won't be included in structure (for obvious
 *   reasons); we hold on to them explicitly so we can spot the difference between a move
 *   and a deletion.
 * * If every GUID on each side is present in the mirror, we have no new records.
 * * If a non-root GUID is present on both sides but not in the mirror, then either
 *   we're re-syncing from scratch, or (unlikely) we have a random collision.
 * * Otherwise, we have a GUID that we don't recognize. We will structure+content reconcile
 *   this later -- we first make sure we have handled any tree moves, so that the addition
 *   of a bookmark to a moved folder on A, and the addition of the same bookmark to the non-
 *   moved version of the folder, will collide successfully.
 *
 * * Walk each subtree, top-down. At each point if there are two back-pointers to
 *   the mirror node for a GUID, we have a potential conflict, and we have all three
 *   parts that we need to resolve it via a content-based or structure-based 3WM.
 *
 * When we look at a child list:
 * * It's the same. Great! Keep walking down.
 * * There are added GUIDs.
 *   * An added GUID might be a move from elsewhere. Coordinate with the removal step.
 *   * An added GUID might be a brand new record. If there are local additions too,
 *     check to see if they value-reconcile, and keep the remote GUID.
 * * There are removed GUIDs.
 *   * A removed GUID might have been deleted. Deletions win.
 *   * A missing GUID might be a move -- removed from here and added to another folder.
 *     Process this as a move.
 * * The order has changed.
 *
 * When we get to a subtree that contains no changes, we can never hit conflicts, and
 * application becomes easier.
 *
 * When we run out of subtrees on both sides, we're done.
 *
 * Match, no conflict? Apply.
 * Match, conflict? Resolve. Might involve moves from other matches!
 * No match in the mirror? Check for content match with the same parent, any position.
 * Still no match? Add.
